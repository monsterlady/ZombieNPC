> Two types of zombie that follows FSM pattern in Animator

# AI_StateMachine_DronesDemo
## What is this Project?

It is a simple implementation of an :robot: A.I. behaviour :suspect:, by using the 'State Pattern' and State Machines in Unity3D :video_game: and C#. It is fully based on two great Blog Articles written by the excellent Tutor:
:necktie: Jason Weimann, of unity3d.college.

## Notes:

:bulb: There are 2 important Scenes in the code:

#### :low_brightness: 1- DroneBadPractice:
An A.I. example using bad coding practices: An Super-Big Switch - Case with too many cases. Each 'case' would correspond to a State of the A.I. (for instance: Walk, Shoot, Dance, etc.); and we would use an 'Enum' variable for the States Name.

#### :low_brightness: 2- Drone:
The recommended A.I. implementation, using a well designed and simple 'State Pattern' in C#. 
The Scripts and code for this Scene can be found inside the  'Assets/scripts/GoodStateMachine/'  folder.


:bulb: I was motivated to rewrite this code because in the Tutorial Jason Weimann did not include the code of the State Machine Pattern, only the 'bad way' of writing A.I. (which is based on a BIIIIIG Switch-Case, with as many States as Enum Values). I think it might be available only to his Patreon Sponsors, which is understandable.


:bulb: This code is not :100: Optimized. It is intended to be a Template for Prototyping and making Game 'Proof-of-Concept' Demos. For making it a final product; it would be necessary to make some changes, for example: replacing the Raycasting implementation in the WanderState.cs class (one of the A.I. States) by one that does less Raycasts (and those Raycasts need to be limited in their extension and size), and we would need to remove the constant execution of GetComponent<>() from the collider. One possible solution would be to cache all game Characters that are to collide (in a Static Dictionary) inside a Component (maybe a Static Class), and compare in each Frame (update() execution) the Collider 'ID' with the one we would have cached (i.e.: a simple Search in the Dictionary, by 'ID'). Using well limited Raycasts is ok, but the command Debug.Raycast is just for 'debugging', so it would need to be commented out too.


:bulb: About the Lighting:
I decided to test an Assets called 'VertexDynamicLightmap' (Vertex Lit Shader: Baked Shadows Realtime Light, made by: Nurface): to allow having Realtime Point Lights :flashlight: (one per Drone) with Baked Lighting (i.e.: a Directional source of light, which would be: :sunny: the Sun), basically Vertex Lit (Rendering Path). It works like a charm and looks fine. 
You can download it in: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/vertex-lit-shader-baked-shadows-realtime-light-75977


:video_game: It was made in Unity 2018.4.0f1.


I hope it to be useful for anybody studying A.I.

## How to play

**W,A,S,D** move the player, **left shift** boost, **space** to jump,
Hold **right button** of mouse to attract zombies.

## Environment

```sh
Unity Version 2020.1.5f1
```
## FSM Design
In this Project, the state machine pattern follows the abstract class ***StateMachineBehaviour*** with ***Animator***,
and the NPC(zombies in this case) cooperate that with the Controller which extends ***MonoBehaviour***

## NPC Intro
the StateMachine Designs could be found in ***.Assets/Scenes***
```sh
Normal Zombie: 
Slow movement, 
poor eyesight and hearing(has a range), 
will not actively attack the player unless the player makes a sound or being bumped
```

```sh
Crazy Zombie:
move fast,
can not see anything,
sensitive to sound, it will run towards whereever the sound made then starting to attack
will not stop attacking target untill it hear another sound
```

```sh
Interaction between NPCs:
It happens when normal zombie bump crazy zombie, the former will be knocked back, the latter will adjust direction to aviod being bothered.
```
